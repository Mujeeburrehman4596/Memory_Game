ðŸ§  Memory Game
Overview
The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game designed to test and improve memory skills. The player competes against the computer to find and match pairs of cards hidden on a grid. Each game session offers a new arrangement of cards, adding an element of unpredictability and fun. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

ðŸŽ® How to Play
Start the game: The player and the computer take turns.
Flip two cards: Click on any two cards to reveal them.
Match cards: If the two cards match, they stay face-up and the player gets another turn. If they don't match, they are flipped back down, and the computer takes its turn.
Continue playing: The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
Win the game: The player or computer with the most matched pairs wins the game.
